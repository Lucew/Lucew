# Hi, I'm Lucas 👋

I’m an engineer, computer scientist, and ML/data practitioner with a research background at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg (Chair of Computer Science 6 / Evolutionary Data Management).

In recent years, my work has focused on large-scale **time series integration** and **time series data mining** — with methods developed in this context also proving useful in other domains, including interplanetary robotics.\
For this research, I collaborate with Siemens Energy, and my initial project on data integration has expanded to large-scale data mining.\
Some of my **prototypes have even left localhost** and are now hosted as internal applications!

What I enjoy most is **working closely with the domain experts** who own the problem: I thoroughly enjoy learning their perspective, new domain knowledge, specific constraints, and consolidating their input into useful algorithms and data processing systems.\
I appreciate interdisciplinary topics because they offer so much to learn and also leave room for me to contribute my own expertise.

I also bring a fairly broad technical background across different application areas. I originally studied information technology (electrical engineering) with a focus on signal processing and have previously worked on topics including **biomedical signal processing**, **algorithmic evaluation of automotive lighting systems**, a short phase in **computer vision** (pose estimation), and biomedical applications.

I care about **useful** ML/data solutions — not just strong results on paper — and I enjoy taking ideas from exploration to implementation.

> 📌 I’ll soon be finishing my time at the university, and I am searching for new opportunities for turning data-heavy problems into reliable tools, workflows, and decisions — even if your problem is not primarily "time series".

## Selected Projects

### [changepoynt](https://github.com/Lucew/changepoynt)
Python package for **change point detection**  
(SST, IKA-SST, uLSIF, RuLSIF, KLIEP, FLUSS, FLOSS, and more)

### [Fast SST](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3640386)
Accelerating change point detection by orders of magnitude (SST), building on a lot of fascinating math and linear algebra (O(N³) -> O(NlogN)).

### [Change Point Detection and Interplanetary Robotics](https://www.cs6.tf.fau.eu/von-zeitreihenintegration-zur-fehlererkennung-fuer-planetare-bohrroboter/)
How my research on time-series integration and change-point detection applies to interplanetary drilling robots. [Update](https://www.cs6.tf.fau.eu/journal-paper-accepted-at-ieee-access-fast-singular-spectrum-transformation-change-point-detection-via-randomized-linear-algebra/)!

### [User-driven Dashboards](https://doi.org/10.1145/3736733.3736742)
How can we visualize large time series collections and their complex relationships?
